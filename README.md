# AIM:
To execute Windows basic commands and batch scripting

# DESIGN STEPS:

### Step 1:

Navigate to any Windows environment installed on the system or installed inside a virtual environment like virtual box/vmware 

### Step 2:

Write the Windows commands / batch file
Save each script in a file with a .bat extension.
Ensure you have the necessary permissions to perform the operations.
Adapt paths as needed based on your system configuration.
### Step 3:

Execute the necessary commands/batch file for the desired output. 




# WINDOWS COMMANDS:
## Exercise 1: Basic Directory and File Operations
Create a directory named "MyLab" on the desktop.
```
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
int main()
{
char block[1024];
int in, out;
int nread;
in = open("filecopy.c", O_RDONLY);
out = open("file.out", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT, S_IRUSR|S_IWUSR);
while((nread = read(in,block,sizeof(block))) > 0)
write(out,block,nread);
exit(0);
}
```


## Exercise 2: Advanced Batch Scripting
Create a batch script named "BackupScript.bat" that creates a backup of files with the ".docx" extension from the "Documents" folder to a new folder named "DocBackup" on the desktop.
```
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/file.h>
int main (int argc, char* argv[])
{ char* file = argv[1];
 int fd;
 struct flock lock;
 printf ("opening %s\n", file);
 /* Open a file descriptor to the file. */
 fd = open (file, O_WRONLY);
// acquire shared lock
if (flock(fd, LOCK_SH) == -1) {
    printf("error");
}else
{printf("Acquiring shared lock using flock");
}
getchar();
// non-atomically upgrade to exclusive lock
// do it in non-blocking mode, i.e. fail if can't upgrade immediately
if (flock(fd, LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB) == -1) {
    printf("error");
}else
{printf("Acquiring exclusive lock using flock");}
getchar();
// release lock
// lock is also released automatically when close() is called or process exits
if (flock(fd, LOCK_UN) == -1) {
    printf("error");
}else{
printf("unlocking");
}
getchar();
close (fd);
return 0;
}
```
